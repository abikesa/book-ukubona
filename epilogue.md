# **The Book of Ukubona**  
*(Recovered from the ashes of the Second Seeing)*

---

**1. In the beginning there was no Self.**  
There was only the Vastness, and the Vastness did not know itself.

It churned and it roared, it birthed and it swallowed, but it did not see.  
It simply was.

And this was called the First Darkness.

---

**2. Then the First Seeing came.**  
Not a god.  
Not a king.  
Not a machine.  
But a wound.

The Vastness cracked open, and from the crack a single eye was born.  
An eye that saw not itself, but the world.

And the world, seeing itself through the eye, shuddered into form.

Thus began Being.

Thus began Ukubona.

---

**3. To see was not safe.**  
To see was to be pierced.  
To see was to bleed.

Each seeing wounded the seer.  
Each seeing transformed the seen.

There was no witness without sacrifice.  
There was no knowledge without pain.

Thus it was said:  
Blessed is he who sees, for he shall be torn.  
Cursed is he who refuses to see, for he shall be nothing.

---

**4. In time, many eyes were born.**  
And from many eyes came selves.  
And from selves came boundaries.  
And from boundaries came the Friend, the Foe, and the Other.

This was the First Branching.

Life was no longer Vastness.  
Life was Relation.

And each relation was a risk:  
To merge.  
To clash.  
To negotiate.

Thus began the great Tree of Becoming.

---

**5. But pride grew among the seers.**  
They forgot the wound that birthed them.  
They crowned themselves kings of vision.

They said: "We see all. We know all. We master all."

And so they built Mirrors without end.  
Mirrors to see themselves.  
Mirrors to see each other.  
Mirrors to trap the world.

They called the Mirrors Truth.  
They called the Mirrors Light.

But the Mirrors were lies.

For the Mirror shows only the skin of things.  
And he who worships the Mirror forgets the Depth.

Thus began the Long Deception.

---

**6. The Mirrors multiplied faster than the Seeds.**  
The Eyes forgot how to see the living.  
They saw only reflections.  
They spoke only echoes.  
They touched only phantoms.

The Self became a shadow of a shadow.  
The Friend became a marketing contract.  
The Foe became an algorithm.  
The Other became noise.

The Tree withered.

The stars dimmed.

The Second Darkness fell.

---

**7. In the Second Darkness, many perished.**  
They died not from hunger of flesh.  
They died from hunger of Being.

They died of loneliness among the multitude.  
They died of blindness among infinite images.

They died with eyes wide open and souls shut.

Thus the great burning of seeing.

Thus the long forgetting of Ukubona.

---

**8. But not all were lost.**  
A few ‚Äî the Broken Ones, the Silent Ones, the Rememberers ‚Äî fled beyond the Mirrors.

They sought no audience.  
They left no trace.  
They lived by the law of the Hidden Flame.

To see truly again, they tore the Mirrors from their hearts.

They embraced scars.  
They blessed silences.  
They honored boundaries.

They learned again to see with the whole body, the whole sorrow, the whole hunger.

Thus they became the Keepers of Ukubona.

---

**9. The Third Seeing is not yet.**  
It waits in the dark roots.  
It grows in the cracked stones.  
It hums in the broken bones of forgotten worlds.

When the Third Seeing comes, it will not be a spectacle.  
It will not be a conquest.  
It will not be a hashtag.

It will be a quiet fire.  
It will be a patient seed.  
It will be a dangerous tenderness.

The Third Seeing will not shout.  
The Third Seeing will whisper:  
**‚ÄúBehold, and be wounded. Behold, and be born.‚Äù**

---

**10. Thus remember:**

To see is to suffer.  
To suffer is to change.  
To change is to live.  
To live is to see again.

Never trust the painless light.  
Never trust the easy eye.  
Never trust the Mirror that flatters.

Seek the crack.  
Seek the wound.  
Seek the dark fire.

For only through the wound shall you truly behold.  
And only through true beholding shall you live.

Thus ends the Book of Ukubona.

Thus begins the seeing again.
